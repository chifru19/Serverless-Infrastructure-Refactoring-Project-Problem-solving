 Project 1: Serverless Infrastructure Refactoring Project
This section details the complex process i executed to successfully publish my completed Terraform/LocalStack project to GitHub, highlighting my problem-solving and CLI skills.
I. Project Overview
This project demonstrates the refactoring and deployment of a modular Serverless data processing pipeline using Terraform and the local cloud environment, LocalStack.Key Skills DemonstratedExplanationInfrastructure as Code (IaC)Modular design and deployment using Terraform.DevOps/TestingUtilization of LocalStack to emulate AWS services (S3, Lambda, IAM) for cost-effective, local testing.Cloud ArchitectureProvisioning a serverless S3 $\rightarrow$ Lambda event-driven pipeline.
II. Detailed Publishing Process & Problem-Solving (For Recruiters)
This narrative focuses on overcoming technical roadblocks to demonstrate real-world proficiency with Git and the command line:
1. Initial Challenge: Remote Repository Failure: The initial attempts to push the code via the command line failed repeatedly with the error fatal: repository '...' not found. This indicated the original GitHub repository link was broken or corrupted.
2. Solution 1: Clean Repository Creation: To bypass the corrupted link, a brand new, clean repository was created (Final-Serverless-Project).
3. Challenge 2: Incorrect File Format: An initial file download was in an incorrect format (HTML/wrong ZIP) which would have broken the Git structure.
4. Solution 2: Web Upload and Verification: The correct project files were downloaded and then uploaded to the new repository using the GitHub drag-and-drop interface, ensuring file integrity and successfully bypassing the command line errors.
5. Final CLI Fix (Authorization/Cache): Despite the web upload, the command line was still unusable for future work. This was resolved by deleting the old local project and performing a successful git clone, using a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication, which created a fresh, working local Git history.https://www.notion.so/Serverless-Infrastructure-Refactoring-Project-Problem-solving-2c530df39c4e80469260d009c2c79728?source=copy_link#2c530df39c4e80d2a8e6f3cf779defe9
